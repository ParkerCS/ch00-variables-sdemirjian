#SECTION 1 - MATH OPERATORS AND VARIABLES (20PTS TOTAL)

#PROBLEM 1 (From Math Class to Code - 2pts)

# Print the answer to the math question:
# 3(60x^2 + 3x/9) + 2x - 4/3(x) - sqrt(x)
# where x = 12.83
x = 12.83
your_answer = "Enter the equation"
print(your_answer)
print(3 * (60 * x ** 2 + (3 * x) / 9) + 2 * x - (4 / 3) * x - x **(1/2))

#PROBLEM 2 (Set your alarm - 3pts)

#You look at the clock and see that it is currently 1:00PM.
# You set an alarm to go off 728 hours later.
# At what time will the alarm go off? Write a program that prints the answer.
# Hint: for the best solution, you will need the modulo operator.
print(728 % 12 + 1)
# Lee - Would like to see this formatted to tell me what I'm looking at.  It is the right answer, but you should use variables (that's the assignment) and should format the print. (-1)


#PROBLEM 3 (Wholesale Books - 3pts)
#The cover price of a book is $27.95, but bookstores get a 50 percent discount.
#Shipping costs $4 for the first copy and 75 cents for each additional copy.
# Calculate the total wholesale costs for 68 copies to the nearest penny.
c = 27.95
cost = x/2 + 75 * 67 + 4
print(round(cost, 2))

# Lee - you make a variable c, but use x from previous problem.  Better variable names will save you here.  Also, make variables for the other numbers.  It makes your code more readable, and gives you the ability to easily adapt the problem later.  (-1)

#PROBLEM 4 (Dining Room Chairs - 3pts)
# You purchase eight chairs for your dining room.
# You pay for the chairs plus sales tax at 9.5%
# Make a program that prints the amount to the nearest penny using the variables below
# Use the round(float, digits) function to get to nearest penny
chair_price = 189.99
tax_percent = 0.095
units = 8
cost = (chair_price * 8) * tax_percent
print(round(cost, 2))

# Lee - You have only calculated tax here instead of the total amount for the purchase (-1)

#PROBLEM 5 (Area of Circle - 3pts)
# Write code that can compute the area of circle.
# Create variables for radius and pi (3.14159)
# The formula, in case you do not know, is radius times radius times pi.
# Print the outcome of your program as follows:
# “The surface area of a circle with radius ... is ...”
import math
radius = int(input("What's the radius of the circle? "))
print(radius**2 * math.pi)


#PROBLEM 6 (Coin counter - 4pts)
# Write code that classifies a given amount of money (which you store in a variable named count),
# as greater monetary units. Your code lists the monetary equivalent in dollars, quarters,
# dimes, nickels, and pennies.
# Your program should report the maximum number of dollars that fit in the amount,
# then the maximum number of quarters that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars,
# then the maximum number of dimes that fit in the remainder after you subtract the dollars and quarters,
# and so on for nickels and pennies.
# The result is that you express the amount as the minimum number of coins needed.
cost = float(input("How much money? "))
dollars = cost // 1
remainder = cost - dollars
quarters = remainder // .25
remainder_2 = remainder - .25 * quarters
dimes = remainder_2 // .10
remainder_3 = remainder_2 - .10 * dimes
nickles = remainder_3 // .05
remainder_4 = remainder_3 - .05 * nickles
if remainder_3 < .05:
    pennies = remainder_3 // .01
else:
    pennies = remainder_4 // .01

print("Dollars: ", dollars)
print("Quarters: ", quarters)
print("Dimes: ", dimes)
print("Nickles: ", nickles)
print("Pennies: ", pennies)

#PROBLEM 7 (Variable Swap - 2pts)
# Can you think of a way to swap the values of two variables that does not
# need a third variable as a temporary storage?
# In the code below, try to implement the swapping of the values of 'a' and 'b' without using a third variable.
# To help you out, the first step to do this is already given.
# You just need to add two more lines of code.

a = 17
b = 23
print( "a =", a, "and b =", b)
a += b # this is the first line to help you out
# add two more lines of code here to cause swapping of a and b
b -= a
a += b
b *= -1
print( "a =", a, "and b =", b)

# Lee - supposed to do this in TWO more lines, not THREE.
